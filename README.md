## FINALLY MONARCH UPDATE
I updated a little all features and made the new single resources to make future extensions/improvements of the code more easily

### NEW 4 RESOURCES + 1 EXTRA
- [Blips](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/mnr_blips)
- [Elevators](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/mnr_elevators)
- [IPL](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/mnr_ipl)
- [SitAnywhere](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/mnr_sitanywhere)
- [Safezones&Speedzones](https://github.com/Monarch-Development/mnr_zones)

### DOCUMENTATION
Our team is expanding so we made more professional documentation with a modern absurd style instead of the usual ones
**Link:** https://monarch-docs.ricodev.it/

**I'm sorry you can't have all the control in one resource anymore but I need it to not go crazy and enlarge and improve the scripts to no end and make them perfect**
